/* Let A[n] be an array of n distinct integers. 
If i < j and A[i] > A[j], then the pair (i, j) is called an inversion of A. 
Write a C/C++ program that determines the number of Inversions in any permutation on n elements in O(nlogn) worst-case time. 
(Hint: Modify merge sort)
Example: A = {4, 1, 3, 2} output is 4 */
